          Hi my name is Sabrina Banks Randall! Iâ€™m a full-stack web developer, photographer, and graphic designer.
          I went through Learn Academy which is a full stack development bootcamp. Some notable skills I developed from this program were becoming an effective communicator while pair-programming, an extrodinary ability to google questions more efficiently, and a advanced understanding of abstract thought! I am primarily interested in front-end web development because it will utilize my skills as a photographer and my graphic design abilities. I am passionate about making reactive responsive webpages, that give users an unforgettable experience!
